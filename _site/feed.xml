        <title>My Experiences with NodeJS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, I have been working with Node.js aka The Node (:D).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Node : Easy to learn, Impossible to master&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to summarize in a line, I would say this (^). If you’ve some experience with JavaScript, then Node is very easy to learn. Google for a few tutorials, play around with &lt;em&gt;Express.js&lt;/em&gt;, and you’re good to go. But as soon as you start playing, you remember, what about database? And, then &lt;em&gt;NPM&lt;/em&gt; comes to the rescue. Few SQL packages could be found, but I always go with Mongo. Easy to work it and open sourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Packages that consist of trivial code no more than 10 lines of code are downloaded in the thousands every day from NPM. Seriously!? You need a dependency for array type checking? And these packages are used by some huge tools such as React.
You’ll never master something that moves at break-neck speed, not to mention the potential of dependency instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to catch errors? Good luck, boss!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me, Coming from other languages such as Python or PHP I’d expect throwing and catching errors, or even returning an error from a function would be a straightforward way of handling errors. It’s not the case with Node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, one gets to pass errors around in the callbacks (or promises) — that’s right! No throwing of exceptions. Not to mention if you forget to return your callback on an error, it continues to run and triggers another set of errors after you returned the initial one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you do manage to come up with a solid standard for your own errors, you can’t confirm (without reading the source) that the many of the NPM packages you have installed follow the same pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts on Node&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go for it. (:D) It’s amazing. It’s fast. It makes Real-Time easy. Well Documented API. And at last, It’s fun.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3586x2017 : New Year’s Resolution</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016 — An amazing year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing happened to me was &lt;a href=&quot;http://foss.amrita.ac.in&quot;&gt;FOSS at Amrita&lt;/a&gt;, my seniors, and mentors. Working with amazing peeps at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikitolearn.org&quot;&gt;WikiToLearn&lt;/a&gt; has made this year even better. Met and connected with awesome people, traveled to a foreign land for the first time (thanks to WikiToLearn again), learned new skills and now working on an exciting product with &lt;a href=&quot;http://under25.club&quot;&gt;Under 25 club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, 2016 was a great year, but that doesn’t necessarily mean this debuting 2017 can’t be a better one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017 — Future as we know it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January 1st is here and it was a long way. After a couple of years watching Mark Zuckerberg setting his goals at the beginning of the year and then showing his accomplishments in December, I decided to start the year with the same idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First: Personal Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life is good right now. I have a happy family, friends whom I trust and I am &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt;. For this 2017, I want to gain some weight, so I’ll start by exercising and running daily. This goal is difficult for me, so I’ll try my best. It’s my first step to get in shape so I’ll keep that in mind and then find a new goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main goal is to make at least &lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt; trips this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second: Work Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny thing, since last year, I have focused my career on working and studying at the same time. This year, I want to continue contributing to WikiToLearn, work with startups and learn interesting and cool stuff like Machine Learning. If some cool app idea or something comes along the way, awesome, but I won’t be desperate about changing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third: Hardware Hacky-Stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be my year for &lt;em&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/em&gt;. I’ll take a course on AI and Machine Learning, so my main goal, much like Zuckerberg’s 2016 goal, is to build something cool using AI and Machine Learning. I want to build something that doesn’t exist yet (atleast planning to), so this summer will serve as exploration and then, in March, I’ll start coding. I hope to find something cool to do so I can show it in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That closes my new year resolutions! Thanks for reading, although I made this mostly for myself, to keep the focus, it’s great someone that reads what I think :) Thank you very much!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Happy New Year!&lt;/em&gt; :D&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is happiness?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I never thought about this before, to be honest. Material things do not necessarily bring you happiness. That is a fact of life. We all know that, then why do we get happy by them? &lt;em&gt;‘If material things bring just a temporary and short-term happiness, then what does that mean?’&lt;/em&gt; Does it mean that we have to buy material objects at a rate of perhaps one per day to sustain the temporary and short-term high of getting something new? The problem is, that begins to sound a lot like a drug habit. This train of thinking got me into some very deep areas. Things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is happiness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it mean to be happy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I want to do in my life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does life have meaning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very deep, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Everything Is Awful and I’m Not Okay: questions to ask before giving up!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day, this article on self care floated across my timeline. I took a look and it looks like a very useful tool for anyone struggling with depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything Is Awful and I’m Not Okay: questions to ask before giving up&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you hydrated?&lt;/strong&gt;  If not, have a glass of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you eaten in the past three hours?&lt;/strong&gt; If not, get some food — something with protein, not just simple carbs.  Perhaps some nuts or hummus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you showered in the past day?&lt;/strong&gt;  If not, take a shower right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If daytime: are you dressed?&lt;/strong&gt;  If not, put on clean clothes that aren’t pajamas.  Give yourself permission to wear something special, whether it’s a funny t-shirt or a pretty dress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If nighttime: are you sleepy and fatigued but resisting going to sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;  Put on pajamas, make yourself cozy in bed with a teddy bear and the sound of falling rain, and close your eyes for fifteen minutes — no electronic screens allowed.  If you’re still awake after that, you can get up again; no pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you stretched your legs in the past day?&lt;/strong&gt;  If not, do so right now.  If you don’t have the spoons for a run or trip to the gym, just walk around the block, then keep walking as long as you please.  If the weather’s crap, drive to a big box store (e.g. Target) and go on a brisk walk through the aisles you normally skip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you said something nice to someone in the past day?&lt;/strong&gt;  Do so, whether online or in person.  Make it genuine; wait until you see something really wonderful about someone, and tell them about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you moved your body to music in the past day?&lt;/strong&gt;  If not, do so — jog for the length of an EDM song at your favorite BPM, or just dance around the room for the length of an upbeat song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you cuddled a living being in the past two days?&lt;/strong&gt;  If not, do so.  Don’t be afraid to ask for hugs from friends or friends’ pets.  Most of them will enjoy the cuddles too; you’re not imposing on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel ineffective?&lt;/strong&gt;  Pause right now and get something small completed, whether it’s responding to an e-mail, loading up the dishwasher, or packing your gym bag for your next trip.  Good job!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel unattractive?&lt;/strong&gt;  Take a goddamn selfie.  Your friends will remind you how great you look, and you’ll fight society’s restrictions on what beauty can look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel paralyzed by indecision?&lt;/strong&gt;  Give yourself ten minutes to sit back and figure out a game plan for the day.  If a particular decision or problem is still being a roadblock, simply set it aside for now, and pick something else that seems doable.  Right now, the important part is to break through that stasis, even if it means doing something trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you seen a therapist in the past few days?&lt;/strong&gt;  If not, hang on until your next therapy visit and talk through things then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you been over-exerting yourself lately — physically, emotionally, socially, or intellectually?&lt;/strong&gt;  That can take a toll that lingers for days. Give yourself a break in that area, whether it’s physical rest, taking time alone, or relaxing with some silly entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you changed any of your medications in the past couple of weeks, including skipped doses or a change in generic prescription brand?&lt;/strong&gt; That may be screwing with your head.  Give things a few days, then talk to your doctor if it doesn’t settle down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you waited a week?&lt;/strong&gt;  Sometimes our perception of life is skewed, and we can’t even tell that we’re not thinking clearly, and there’s no obvious external cause.  It happens.  Keep yourself going for a full week, whatever it takes, and see if you still feel the same way then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve made it this far, and you will make it through.  &lt;strong&gt;You are stronger than you think.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author was kind enough to create a printable Google Doc that’s well-organized and can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6A2F5ky9SELU0Zfd05YMEpyNUk/view&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. They also released it under Creative Commons, which is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>FUDCon APAC Phnom Penh Cambodia 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was selected for delivering a talk on WikiToLearn at the FUDCon APAC, Phnom Penh, Cambodia from 4th to 6th November, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fudcon.png&quot; alt=&quot;fudcon&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FUDCon (Fedora Users and Developers Conference) is an important event in the world of free software that is held in different parts of the world organized by Fedora Organization. The FUDCon comprised of sessions, talks, workshops and hackfest in which project participants worked on specific initiatives. FUDCon Phnom Penh was conducted at Norton University, Phnom Penh along Barcamp ASEAN. Around 50 speakers from around the world gave talks related to entrepreneurship and open source software. I was traveling with one my friends, Abhinand N, who also got selected to deliver a talk on Mediawiki. Looked like, we were the only two undergrads who were invited to deliver talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first international trip and pretty amazing. My itinerary was something like this : Cochin -&amp;gt; Kuala Lumpur -&amp;gt; Phnom Penh (4th November) and Phnom Penh -&amp;gt; Bangkok -&amp;gt; Cochin (9th November).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phnom Penh looked more or less like an Indian city just with more &lt;strong&gt;prettier&lt;/strong&gt; girls (:D) and &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; public transport. We reached Phnom Penh on 4th evening, and a tuktuk driver was waiting for us at the airport to take us to the hotel. If you’re wondering what a tuktuk looks like, see this :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/tuk-tuk.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;tuktuk&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we reached Hotel, it was almost Dinner time. Sirko Kemter was the local organizer and all the developers decided to go to a nearby BBQ place. Remember, Abhinand is a &lt;strong&gt;pure&lt;/strong&gt; vegeterian and he came to eat BBQ (:P). Anyway, the food was great, since I had never tried Lobster and Prawn. Amazing experience, it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of dinner, I interacted with rest of the Fedora developers from India, Australia, China and USA. &lt;a href=&quot;https://kushaldas.in/&quot;&gt;Kushal Das&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sayanchowdhury.com/&quot;&gt;Sayan Chowdhary&lt;/a&gt; were among the famous open source developers from India. It was great meeting and interacting with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1 : FUDCon APAC, Norton University, Phnom Penh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FUDCon Day 1 was pretty amazing. We started off with Barcamp pitches followed by &lt;em&gt;Fedora State of the Union&lt;/em&gt; talk from &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Bex&quot;&gt;Brian Exelbierd&lt;/a&gt;, Fedora Community Action and Impact Coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/brian.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brian&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first talk I went to was &lt;em&gt;Introduction to Rust Programming Language by&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/a2batic&quot;&gt;Kanika Murarka&lt;/a&gt;. Kanika actively contributes to Fedora, and is an intern at Red Hat, Bangalore. She engrossed us, telling that Rust is designed to be a safe, concurrent, practical language, supporting functional paradigms and is sponsored by Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/kanika.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;kanika&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch was pretty interesting. Everyone gathered at a common lunch place with full of local khmer snacks, jackfruits, veg fried rice and non veg rice. Veg food had egg in it, so yeah! (:D) Lunch was okayish, but what made it interesting was the discussion! I had a long discussion with &lt;a href=&quot;http://sumantrom.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Sumantro Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pnemade&quot;&gt;Parag Nemade&lt;/a&gt; about my project and it was great! After the discussion, we followed for the next series of talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/lunch.png&quot; alt=&quot;lunch&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next talk, I went onto was &lt;em&gt;How to globalize your software by&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pnemade&quot;&gt;Parag Nemade&lt;/a&gt;. Parag Nemade is a Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat. He is an active contributor to Fedora project, sponsor for packager group, proven packager, helps in improving Fedora packaging and testing Fedora updates. Parag introduced us to Globalization. It is a collaborative work done by internationalizing, localizing your software. He told us how important it is to globalize the code you write. Then he told what Localization is and how to add internationalization in code by showing some code examples. It was a great talk!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/paragn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;paragn&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following talk was by &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Aeng&quot;&gt;Alex Eng&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Zanata, a translation platform&lt;/em&gt;. One of the best and interesting talk for the day. Alex presented a round up of the new features that will be available in the next release of the translation tool. I was very eager to learn more about how Zanata works, and therefore had a brief conversation with him. I was fascinated about the new editor and discussed  my GSoC project and collaborative editing would work in Zanata. Handling translations is very challenging and great thing is that, WikiToLearn is also looking for ways to implement Zanata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/alex.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;paragn&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next talk was on &lt;em&gt;Web Virtual Reality&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://sumantrom.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Sumantro Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt;. The highlight of the talk was a-frame. A-frame is a web framework for building virtual reality experiences and works on almost all devices. With just few lines of code, you can turn a video into 360 degree Virtual Reality. Amazing, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/sumantro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sumantro&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last talk of the day was by &lt;a href=&quot;anweshadas.in&quot;&gt;Anwesha Das&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;A walk on licenses in Fedora ecosystem&lt;/em&gt;. She gave an overview of all the open source licenses, why it is important to use a license and what are the best practices of using a license. The take from the talk was not to use &lt;em&gt;personalized&lt;/em&gt; licenses and even if you use it, not to name it like &lt;strong&gt;Buy me a beer&lt;/strong&gt; or something similar. Overall, it was great to learn about Licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/anwesha.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;anwesha&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day ended with all the Indians and Ryan going to a Riverside Restaurant and having amazing food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2 : FUDCon APAC, Norton University, Phnom Penh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2 started with heavy rains at Cambodia. Thanks to Sirko for providing raincoats! It was another day of interesting talks and I had my talk at 3pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first talk I went to was by &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Noriko&quot;&gt;Noriko Mizumoto&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;How can you help us get Fedora to the world?&lt;/em&gt;. Noriko hails from Japan and is a Community Relations Specialist and Program Manager, Red Hat Asia Pacific. Noriko focused on the importance of localization. Localization of a software is very important, since non-native English speakers are much more when compared to native English speakers.She introduced how Fedora has been localized into over 80 languages. A great talk, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/noriko.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;noriko&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following was the talk on &lt;em&gt;Exploring Fedora Infrastructure&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://sayanchowdhury.com/&quot;&gt;Sayan Chowdhary&lt;/a&gt;. Sayan Chowdhary is a Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat, Pune and has been a Python developer contributing to Fedora. Sayan talked about Fedora web projects and how can one contribute to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/sayan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sayan&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next was the talk by &lt;a href=&quot;http://kushaldas.in&quot;&gt;Kushal Das&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Testing Fedora Atomic in an automated way&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t need to introduce him (:P). He talked about testing fedora atomic project in an automated way by using Python and Go script made by him. It went over my head mostly, since I never contributed to Fedora. Anyway, it is always amazing to listen him speaking. The way he explains a scenario, is absolutely stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/kushal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;kushal&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the better lunch, next talk I attended was on &lt;em&gt;Fedora QA&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sumantro Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt;. Sumantro introduced us to Fedora Quality Assurance, the workflow and how to test a package. Great talk, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/sumantro2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sumantro&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it was time for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wwww.srijanagarwal.me&quot;&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; talk on &lt;strong&gt;WikiToLearn&lt;/strong&gt; : &lt;em&gt;Bringing Academia to the Internet Era : A revolution in Knowledge Sharing&lt;/em&gt;. I introduced WikiToLearn to the attendees, how to contribute and gave them a hand-on session on “How to make a personalized book”. I briefed on how WikiToLearn is being adapted at European Universities and making it easier for students and professors for collaborative learning. I spoke on who/how can contribute being a student, teacher, translator or hacker, how the project is having powerful impact not only in Europe but also in the world with many universities involved and also organizations like KDE, Wikimedia Foundation and the CERN, About the power of collaboration and its impact in academia with the help of WikiToLearn and also how students and professors are using it in their universities as a tool to make learning much more effective in a collaborative way. Slides for the talk can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://slides.com/srijancse/wikitolearn-2&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last talk was on &lt;em&gt;Contributing to Mediawiki&lt;/em&gt; by Abhinand N. Abhinand is a Google Summer of Code’16 select for Mediawiki. He actively contributes to Mediawiki. He introduced attendees to Mediawiki and how can one contribute to Mediawiki by code. He briefed about Gerrit and the workflow of patch submission. It was a great talk, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/abhinand.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;abhinand&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a great party after the talks at Fudpub with Barcamp organizers. Free beer, yaay (:D).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/party2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;party&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first time, I attended Fedora event and it was amazing to meet and interact with developers around the world including Gerard Braad, Siddesh Poyarekar, Mohan Prakash, Jens Peterson, Nisha Poyarekar, Estu Fardani, Robert Mayr, Ryan Lerch and Tommy He. Kudos to the local organizers and KDE for sponsoring my trip. Overall, it was an amazing experience which I’m going to cherish for long.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MediaWikiToLearn Hackathon, Amrita University Amritapuri Campus 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;FOSS@Amrita conducted Mediawiki Hackathon at Amrita University, Amritapuri Campus on 1st and 2nd October, 2016.
MediaWikiToLearn Hackathon was organised to bring more new students into the field of Open Source Contribution, thereby giving them a chance to interact with developers online. Provide an opportunity to learn the workflow of bug fixing and patch submission in MediaWiki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikitolearn.org&quot;&gt;WikiToLearn&lt;/a&gt; to the professors and students of Amrita University, Amritapuri Campus!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/talk2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;talk&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WikiToLearn Editathon was concluded with a good number of edits and personalized books made by 25 professors on subjects varying from Biotechnology, Business, Physics, and Mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pywikibot Mediawiki hacking session led by Abdeali Kothari was a great success as students could grasp the fundamentals well and catch up with their tasks. Though it was a bit hard for participants to get started with their first bug fix. By the end of second day of MediaWiki Hackathon, we could get more than 5 patches uploaded to Gerrit.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MediaWiki Hackathon BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was invited by BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus, to give a talk on WikiToLearn at the MediaWiki Hackathon on 24th and 25th September, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great event indeed, and an amazing experience to speak about WikiToLearn among those students. I spoke on ‘How to contribute to WikiToLearn’ and the talk can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://slides.com/srijancse/wikitolearn&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few amazing things, I found out at BITS was :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;0% attendance requirements, creating nocturnal but hardcore engineers! Met crazy &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Soni&quot;&gt;Subham Soni&lt;/a&gt; waking up at 6 pm, like its 6 am. Met couple of others brushing at 20:00 in the washroom, getting ready for work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give students bad mess food, they would complain.
Give students good mess food, they would complain in a month.
Baffled at crazy &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Soni&quot;&gt;Subham Soni&lt;/a&gt; addressing their mess food as boring/bad etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since, this was my first visit to Hyderabad, I also got an opportunity to roam around the city, with my BPHC Friends, Utkarsh and Utsav. Some of the photos :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit to Charminar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
     &lt;img src=&quot;/images/Charminar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;profile image&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;image-block&quot;&gt;
     &lt;img src=&quot;/images/bphc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;profile image&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrap&quot;&gt;

        <title>Contributing to Open Source</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since everyone was asking me this question regularly, I thought of writing a blog post of it. So, these are the points, once should be focusing on to crack Google Summer of Code or similar SoC programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good understanding of one programming language of your choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding of a programming language is not just knowing the syntax or how recursion works. If you already know that, great! You are past the first hurdle. Next, you need to take up the task of learning the multiple major libraries and packages that are going to be used in any medium to large scale project. Look up the relevant libraries of your programming language and devote time to learning them. A good understanding of these will go a long way in helping you understand any code base better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Version Control System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is where Github comes in. Distributed revision control(DVCS) is a way of collaborative coding which makes sure that all the code remains secure and concurrent at any given point of time. All, and I mean ALL, organisations use some form of Version Control. Major ones are SVN and Git. Although now mostly every organisation have switched to Git for some of its features, some might still be using SVN. Github is just a Git client which lets you host your code online. Learning Github is not the same as learning Git. Therefore, first, learn Git — Book then, moves on to learn how to use Github. For quick reference, you can also use this: Try Git Having familiarity with version control will give you quite an edge over other candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn to read the source code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no substitute for the ability to read through seemingly gigantic code bases. Let’s face it, most of the documentation of any code available is very bad at the best. It may be useful to the end user, but for any new developer, it’s just gibberish. You are on your own when you need to go through the source code of something which spans hundreds of thousands of lines with hundreds of files. Where do you start? Well, it depends. Lear how to use Bug/Issue Trackers Every organisation will have a bug tracker. If you don’t know what a Software bug is, now will be a good time to start. Bug trackers are like the Version Control systems which we talked about earlier. In fact, most version control clients will have an implementation of the bug tracker themselves. Github has an “Issues” system, which is the same thing. A bug tracker, basically, lists all the “issues”(or bugs) currently identified with the software and their “status”(are they solved? Unsolved? Being worked upon). Bug trackers provide the non-developer end users with a way of pointing out a problem in the software. They might also be used to request a new feature, which is different from a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submit Patches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve learnt all of the above(and trust me, it is not much), you are ready to submit some patches or bug fixes to a project of your choice. Choose any open source project which is written in a language you know, and more importantly, interests you, and go and browse through its bug tracker. Most bug trackers have issues marked as “volunteer” or “introductory”. Search for such issues, or go with any issue which you think you can fix. Comment/update the issue saying you are taking it up. Solve it on your local system (you’ll know what this is once you know how to use version control) and then push it to the organisation’s remote code base. This is easier said than done, let’s be honest. You’ll need to know at the very least, 1) What DVCS the project is using. 2) What are their workflows for code contribution? (Most organisations have a defined way to submit a patch and you &lt;strong&gt;MUST&lt;/strong&gt; follow that). 3) How to get involved with the community. Because even open source projects won’t accept unauthorised/unreliable code from some newcomer. More on this on the next point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select an organisation/project and contribute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can come either after or before the last point. If you have no idea which organisation interests you, go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code 2016&lt;/a&gt; and browse through the list of accepted organisation. Most organisations get accepted recurringly, so you are safe in picking an org which has been accepted 2–3 times already, filter according to the language of your choice. Once you’ve picked an organisation, start creating a good reputation for yourself. To do this,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Get in contact with the developers. Use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.irccloud.com&quot;&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;, subscribe to the developer Mailing List of that org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Submit patches. Nothing will help your case as much as your coding capability. Fix bugs. Even one is good. Start with the easiest of bugs. If in doubt, ask the devs to direct you to the bug they think will be good for you to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Get familiar with their workflow. This includes, how they contribute code, their coding style, if they hold any online meetings (do attend) etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask (Smart) Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are up and running contributing to a project, you &lt;strong&gt;WILL&lt;/strong&gt; face difficulties. You might not know how a particular piece of code is working, or you might not know about the required technology. This is the time for you to ASK. Ask the established developers in that project, or anyone you think who might know the answer, in general. Asking is not stupid and will see you through a lot of unnecessary struggle. But at the same time remember, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html&quot;&gt;How To Ask Questions The Smart Way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what you can do to lift your chances before the application period starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps you guys. Also, if someone wants to contribute to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikitolearn.org&quot;&gt;WikiToLearn&lt;/a&gt; can contact me anytime. :)&lt;/p&gt;
