---

I'm a Software Engineer at Microsoft, working on Microsoft Office. I'm interested in all aspects of programming and this blog was created to share my investigations. My primary research interests lie in a broad aread of programming languages and compilers. I mostly program in R, C, C++ nowadays, but I am also experienced with Java, Python and SQL programming. I would like to consider myself a tool builder, I enjoy developing computational tools that make programmers' lifes easier.
