I never thought about this before, to be honest. Material things do not necessarily bring you happiness. That is a fact of life. We all know that, then why do we get happy by them? *‘If material things bring just a temporary and short-term happiness, then what does that mean?’* Does it mean that we have to buy material objects at a rate of perhaps one per day to sustain the temporary and short-term high of getting something new? The problem is, that begins to sound a lot like a drug habit. This train of thinking got me into some very deep areas. Things like:

+ **What is happiness?**
+ **What does it mean to be happy?**
+ **What do I want to do in my life?**
+ **Does life have meaning?**

Very deep, isn’t it?
