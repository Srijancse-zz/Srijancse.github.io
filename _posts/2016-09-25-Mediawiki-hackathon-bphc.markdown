I was invited by BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus, to give a talk on WikiToLearn at the MediaWiki Hackathon on 24th and 25th September, 2016.

It was a great event indeed, and an amazing experience to speak about WikiToLearn among those students. I spoke on 'How to contribute to WikiToLearn' and the talk can be found [here](https://slides.com/srijancse/wikitolearn).

Few amazing things, I found out at BITS was :
1.  0% attendance requirements, creating nocturnal but hardcore engineers! Met crazy [Subham Soni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Soni) waking up at 6 pm, like its 6 am. Met couple of others brushing at 20:00 in the washroom, getting ready for work.

2. Give students bad mess food, they would complain
Give students good mess food, they would complain in a month.
Baffled at crazy [Subham Soni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Soni) addressing their mess food as boring/bad etc.

Since, this was my first visit to Hyderabad, I also got an opportunity to roam around the city, with my BPHC Friends, Utkarsh and Utsav. Some of the photos :
