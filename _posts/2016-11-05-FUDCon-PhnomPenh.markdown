FUDCon (Fedora Users and Developers Conference) is an important event in the world of free software that is held in different parts of the world organized by Fedora Organization. The FUDCon comprised of sessions, talks, workshops and hackfest in which project participants worked on specific initiatives. FUDCon Phnom Penh was conducted at Norton University, Phnom Penh along Barcamp ASEAN. Around 50 speakers from around the world gave talks related to entrepreneurship and open source software. I was traveling with one my friends, Abhinand N, who also got selected to deliver a talk on Mediawiki. Looked like, we were the only two undergrads who were invited to deliver talks.

It was my first international trip and pretty amazing. My itinerary was something like this : Cochin -> Kuala Lumpur -> Phnom Penh (4th November) and Phnom Penh -> Bangkok -> Cochin (9th November).

Phnom Penh looked more or less like an Indian city just with more **prettier** girls (:D) and **no** public transport. We reached Phnom Penh on 4th evening, and a tuktuk driver was waiting for us at the airport to take us to the hotel. If you're wondering what a tuktuk looks like, see this :

As soon as we reached Hotel, it was almost Dinner time. Sirko Kemter was the local organizer and all the developers decided to go to a nearby BBQ place. Remember, Abhinand is a **pure** vegeterian and he came to eat BBQ (:P). Anyway, the food was great, since I had never tried Lobster and Prawn. Amazing experience, it was.

At the time of dinner, I interacted with rest of the Fedora developers from India, Australia, China and USA. [Kushal Das](https://kushaldas.in/), [Sayan Chowdhary](http://sayanchowdhury.com/) were among the famous open source developers from India. It was great meeting and interacting with them.

FUDCon Day 1 was pretty amazing. We started off with Barcamp pitches followed by *Fedora State of the Union* talk from [Brian Exelbierd](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Bex), Fedora Community Action and Impact Coordinator.

The first talk I went to was *Introduction to Rust Programming Language by* [Kanika Murarka](https://twitter.com/a2batic). Kanika actively contributes to Fedora, and is an intern at Red Hat, Bangalore. She engrossed us, telling that Rust is designed to be a safe, concurrent, practical language, supporting functional paradigms and is sponsored by Mozilla.

Lunch was pretty interesting. Everyone gathered at a common lunch place with full of local khmer snacks, jackfruits, veg fried rice and non veg rice. Veg food had egg in it, so yeah! (:D) Lunch was okayish, but what made it interesting was the discussion! I had a long discussion with [Sumantro Mukherjee](http://sumantrom.blogspot.com) and [Parag Nemade](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pnemade) about my project and it was great! After the discussion, we followed for the next series of talks.

Next talk, I went onto was *How to globalize your software by* [Parag Nemade](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pnemade). Parag Nemade is a Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat. He is an active contributor to Fedora project, sponsor for packager group, proven packager, helps in improving Fedora packaging and testing Fedora updates. Parag introduced us to Globalization. It is a collaborative work done by internationalizing, localizing your software. He told us how important it is to globalize the code you write. Then he told what Localization is and how to add internationalization in code by showing some code examples. It was a great talk!

The following talk was by [Alex Eng](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Aeng) on *Zanata, a translation platform*. One of the best and interesting talk for the day. Alex presented a round up of the new features that will be available in the next release of the translation tool. I was very eager to learn more about how Zanata works, and therefore had a brief conversation with him. I was fascinated about the new editor and discussed  my GSoC project and collaborative editing would work in Zanata. Handling translations is very challenging and great thing is that, WikiToLearn is also looking for ways to implement Zanata.

The next talk was on *Web Virtual Reality* by [Sumantro Mukherjee](http://sumantrom.blogspot.com). The highlight of the talk was a-frame. A-frame is a web framework for building virtual reality experiences and works on almost all devices. With just few lines of code, you can turn a video into 360 degree Virtual Reality. Amazing, isn't it?

The last talk of the day was by [Anwesha Das](anweshadas.in) on *A walk on licenses in Fedora ecosystem*. She gave an overview of all the open source licenses, why it is important to use a license and what are the best practices of using a license. The take from the talk was not to use *personalized* licenses and even if you use it, not to name it like **Buy me a beer** or something similar. Overall, it was great to learn about Licenses.
