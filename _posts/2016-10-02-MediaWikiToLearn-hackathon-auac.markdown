FOSS@Amrita conducted Mediawiki Hackathon at Amrita University, Amritapuri Campus on 1st and 2nd October, 2016.
MediaWikiToLearn Hackathon was organised to bring more new students into the field of Open Source Contribution, thereby giving them a chance to interact with developers online. Provide an opportunity to learn the workflow of bug fixing and patch submission in MediaWiki.

I spoke about [WikiToLearn](http://www.wikitolearn.org) to the professors and students of Amrita University, Amritapuri Campus!

WikiToLearn Editathon was concluded with a good number of edits and personalized books made by 25 professors on subjects varying from Biotechnology, Business, Physics, and Mathematics.

The Pywikibot Mediawiki hacking session led by Abdeali Kothari was a great success as students could grasp the fundamentals well and catch up with their tasks. Though it was a bit hard for participants to get started with their first bug fix. By the end of second day of MediaWiki Hackathon, we could get more than 5 patches uploaded to Gerrit.
