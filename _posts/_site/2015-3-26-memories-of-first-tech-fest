The first Tech Fest of IIIT Allahabad Aparoksha turned out to be quite awesome. My experince started with Coldfire which was the first offline Technical event of Aparoksha.  Coldfire was an event in which you have to identify the vulnurabilities in web applications. Even tough I have a little bit experince in developing small web applications I had very little knowladge in penetration tests. But the unexpected happened on that day. I and my roommate Bhagyraj emerged as the winner of Coldfire cracking all the 10 problems in Coldfire. The first two questions was based on injecting javascript code through the GET variables. 

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">scr</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/script&gt;ipt&gt;alert(&#39;Hacked :p&#39;)&lt;/scr&lt;/script&gt;ipt&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

Some questions involved encrypting the javascript code to ASCII and decrypting again and evaluating with the help of `eval` function. There were also a few questions on SQL injection which turned out to be quite simple. In one question all we needed was to change the input the username as * which retrieved all the rows. 

There were some tricky questions which involved finding the MAC adress and hostname of the server. We were meant to find the MAC adress by injecting to server a call to `phpinfo()`. But since the server was in the same computer lab as we were in we just used the ' arp -an ` command to find the mac adress of the computers in the newtork. Since the IP adress was already knows the rest of the part was pretty simple. One question was to find the Apache version of the server. We couldn't find a way to retrieve this information so we simply brute forced the possible Apache versions. 

The other event which I took part was IT Quiz. Unfortunately our team suffered an early second round exit. Then came the Codeshow finals. Codeshow was an ACM ICPC styled competetion. There was a prelims which took place a few weeks before. Around 20 teams which were able to solve more than 3 problems which choosen for the onsite. We were not able to get a prize but it was really an awesome experince.
