<p>A great programmer or developer should be strong in Data Structures and Algorithms. Once you are comfortable with your favorite language of choice (I would recommend C++) start spending time on basic Data structures and Algorithms.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The most recommended book for studying Data structures and Algorithms is Introduction to Algorithms popularly known as CLRS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also recommend you the Design and Analysis of Algorithms on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algo">Coursera</a> by Stanford University.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a piece of advice I got from my super senior (Divanshu Garg, SE at Google Australia) when I was in first year. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like I used to do a lot of SPOJ in the first year, and kept on reading Cormen. Honestly, back then, I usually couldn’t understand everything because the book is advanced but I used to learn something every time I read it. If u cant understand a simple algo, read it over the INTERNET to understand more. then practice some related questions on SPOJ.</p>

<p>It is very important to write the code when you learn a new algorithm or data structure. One way of accomplishing this is via online judges. If you love solving puzzles you would love it. Here are my favorite online judges for beginners.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://train.usaco.org/usacogate">USACO Training Gateway</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://spoj.com/">SPOJ</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://lightoj.com/">LightOJ</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://codechef.com/">Codechef</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://codeforces.com">Codeforces</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Among this the USACO training gateway contains both Tutorials and Problems organized in a systematic way. This site would help you to learn the basic fundamentals quickly if you don’t have much experience with algorithms. </p>

<p>LightOJ contains problems organized category wise and is a good resource for preparing for ACM ICPC. </p>
