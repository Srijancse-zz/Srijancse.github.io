<p>This is my first post. After thinking for a day about what should be blogged, I finally settled on <code>Mozcafe</code> . You may be most probably wondering now, what the heck is Mozcafe. Even tough it sounds something like a restaurant it’s not. Mozcafe is an event conducted with the help of <code>Mozilla foundation</code> around the world where FOSS lovers come together and share their idea. Recently a Mozcafe was conducted in IIIT Allahabad with the support of IIIT Allahabad <code>Firefox Club</code>. I was a member of the Firefox Club so I got chance to be a part of the organizing team of Mozcafe along with my seniors Rahul, Aditya, Jatin, Ankit, Charul, Atul, Ashoka, Pawan and fellow batch mates Anurag and Abhishek. This post would be about how we prepared for Mozcafe and how it went.</p>

<p>It all started for me when Rahul sir called me and told that Firefox club is going to organize Mozcafe on February 24. I didn’t knew what Mozcafe was at that time so he told me patiently about the whole event. I was so excited about the idea and decided to be a apart of the event. Soon there was a meeting regarding the Event and various members were assigned various duties. I and Abhishek got the task of making intro videos for the event. My only prior experience on this field was the Pinnacle Videospin sftware with which used to add some minor edits to video. But what I was asked to do was to make a video regarding Firefox club and another one on Open Source and Mozilla. The best part of all was that mid sems were approaching in fast pace and like 99% of the IIITians I haven’t touched the books so far. We decided to forget about mid sems for a couple of days and started our adventure on video making. Our adventure would have failed if there was not a site called http://www.powtoons.com or if they charged money for making videos.</p>

<p>After 1 day we came up with our first video. Since it was our first video I and Abhishek conducted shows of the video in the hostel at least 20 times in various occasions. Most of times my fellow hostel mates slipped into sleep when the video reached the half. But I and Abhishek never gave up and watched the video again and again with new friends joining each time. We collected feedback from our friends and improved it.</p>

<p>After the completion of the first video we began to work on the second video. This time it took us only 2 hours to complete the video. Even tough this video was only a minute in length it was the best of the two videos we made.</p>

<p>Along with the task of making videos I was also assigned to prepare some Quiz questions for the event. Which means I have to go to the stage to ask Questions. The very thought of facing a crowd of 1000 along on the stage made me nervous. So Abhishek told me that he will come with me to support me on Quiz and we began count down for Mozcafe. Posters were posted all over the campus and the whole institute began to wait for Mozcafe. We did many mock runs on the auditorium and was all set for the event.</p>

<p>February 24 came faster than expected. Many professors came to attend the event along with students. Audio Lightning Club(Thunderbolt) took over the control of the audio and lights of the auditorium. Soon Mozilla Rep Shahid Farooqui joined us. The event was officially kick started at 3.30. Shahid Farooqui gave a long speech on Mozilla and FOSS. After the speech I and Abhishek was called on the Stage to show our video. We presented the video and the crowd accepted it wholeheartedly. We were called once again to conduct the Quiz which turned out to be a fun session. We started off the quiz dramatically by taking the Question of the Quiz from the seat of a student.</p>

<p>Many other talks followed and some of the best ones were talk on GSOC, introduction to Github and Blogging. We were once again called to present our 2nd video. During the event we asked the audience to write about some cool inventions which they have in their mind. W collected all the idea and made an idea board. The best ideas were rewarded with Parker pens. We also managed to give the audience snacks among with fruity and munch. When the event ended most of them had had a feeling of achievement in their face.</p>

<p>Mozcafe organized by Firefox club was able to bring many changes in the campus. Many of my friends contacted me on on Facebook asking for help to get started on Google Summer Of Code. Some of them had doubts on IRCs while some had problem with MDN and gitHub. A wiki media club is also to be launched in the coming semester by some students who want to contribute to free and open source.</p>

<p>I am happy to be a part of the change which is now taking place in IIIT Allahabad. More over doing good not only feels good. It also leads to better good.</p>
